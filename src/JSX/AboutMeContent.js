        When Lisa suffered a tragic back-breaking figure skating accident at 20
        years-old, she was forced to give up her Olympic dreams. Bed-ridden from
        her injury, a close friend loaned her a camera as a method to explore
        her creativity. In late 2006, Lisa started posting her adventures and
        photographs on her blog. Sharing her photography and connecting with an
        incredible blogging community ignited her passion for life and helped
        her heal from her back injury. After experiencing the healing power of
        photography in her own life, Lisa was determined to bring accessible
        creative photography and video to everyone. She cofounded several
        best-selling iPhone/iPad apps including; Camera+ in 2008, MagiCam in
        2014, Vee for Video in 2015 and acquired Filters in 2015. Lisa is a
        graduate of the University of Victoria with a Bachelor’s degree in
        Linguistics and Journalism, and a Master’s degree in Linguistics. Her
        research focused on early infant speech acquisition and acoustics. After
        living abroad for the past few years in San Francisco and New York, Lisa
        has returned to her home on Vancouver Island in beautiful British
        Columbia. She currently lives in Comox, BC with her husband, an RCAF
        pilot and her daughter Kate. Lisa continues to passionately share her
        photography tips, adventures, and travels with her 3 million followers
        hoping to inspire them to capture beautiful memories with whatever
        camera they have.
